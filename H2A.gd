audio.txt    documents.txt  photo.txt  videos.txt
devices.txt  pdf.txt       

then makes a dir with the same name so like photo.txt will make a folder called photo and in the .txt file of is a bunch of url like this
https://thing.pdf
https://anotherone.pdf
download the files into the folder that gose along with the thing
